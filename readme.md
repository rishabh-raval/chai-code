# MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System)

MCAS is a flight control software installed in Boeing 787 airplanes. Its primary function is to enhance the handling characteristics and ensure aircraft stability during specific flight conditions.

## Features

- **Automatic Stabilizer Adjustment:** MCAS automatically adjusts the horizontal stabilizer to improve pitch stability.
- **Enhanced Safety:** Designed to assist pilots in maintaining control during high angle-of-attack situations.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works in conjunction with existing flight control systems.

## How It Works

MCAS monitors sensor data, such as angle of attack (AoA), and activates when certain thresholds are met. When engaged, it commands the stabilizer to move, helping to prevent excessive nose-up attitudes.

## System Requirements

- Boeing 787 aircraft with compatible avionics
- Certified installation and maintenance

## Safety and Compliance

MCAS is developed in accordance with aviation safety standards and undergoes rigorous testing and certification processes.
